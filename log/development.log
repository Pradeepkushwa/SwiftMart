ActionView::Template::Error (Ransack needs AdminUser attributes explicitly allowlisted as
searchable. Define a `ransackable_attributes` class method in your `AdminUser`
model, watching out for items you DON'T want searchable (for
example, `encrypted_password`, `password_reset_token`, `owner` or
other sensitive information). You can use the following as a base:

```ruby
class AdminUser < ApplicationRecord

  # ...

  def self.ransackable_attributes(auth_object = nil)
    ["created_at", "email", "encrypted_password", "id", "id_value", "remember_created_at", "reset_password_sent_at", "reset_password_token", "updated_at"]
